    <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>This recipe has been a favorite of mine for a long time. I've
        made it the same way for years, but feel free to pice it up a bit
        with the recipe shown in the provided link</p>
    
        <p>My version only has three main ingredients besides 
        the salmon, but it still provides a restaurant qulity 
        dish that will easily impress guests. The ingredient amounts
        will provide enough glaze for about two pieces of 8oz salmon cuts, add 
        or reduce as needed.</p>
